Yes, HTML should be written before CSS, however...

You do NOT write all HTML on the page, and then go back to write the CSS. This would make it extremely difficult to clearly remember the sections as you build it out, even with proper spacing and comments.

You build a website in layers, as if you are making a multi-layered cake.

1st Layer - First you build the base, the container div, with it's min-height and width css.

2nd Layer - Then you build the next layer, the large sections of the page (divs and styling for structure), such as rows or sections looking like columns.

3rd Layer and beyond - Then you keep adding within the second layer of sections.
